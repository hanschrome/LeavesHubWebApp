This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.0.0.

## Setup project

### 1 - Fill configuration

In src > environments you will find two files, for development and for production.

The properties you should fill:

* api - Endpoint of the API you are consuming. Examples: https://api.mysiteweb.com, http://localhost:8000, http://172.17.0.2  
* reCaptchaSiteKey - Captcha code got from [Google recaptcha admin site](https://www.google.com/recaptcha/admin/create). Example: 2Ld3jl9gAAAAAHMWDQ9UDsip63s_vdLvYRMyZrkD

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
